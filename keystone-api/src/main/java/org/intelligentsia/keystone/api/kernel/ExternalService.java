/**
 * 
 * ExternalService.
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * From design pattern:<br />
 * An external service is a component that uses the microkernel for implementing
 * its own view of the underlying application domain. As already mentioned, a
 * view denotes a layer of abstraction built on top of the atomic services
 * provided by the microkernel. Different external servers implement different
 * policies for specific application domains.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * External service expose their functionality by exporting interfaces in the
 * same way as the microkernel itself does. Each of these external service runs
 * in a separate process. It receives service requests from client applications
 * using the communication facilities provided by the microkernel, interprets
 * these requests, executes the appropriate services and returns results to its
 * clients. The implementation of services relies on microkernel mechanisms, so
 * external servers need to access the microkernelâ€™s programming interfaces.
